// App is the framework-owned run loop: the terminal's lifetime, the
// input decoder, the dispatcher, frame scheduling, hot-reload swaps and
// the console signal story, in one object.
//
// It exists because every app had been hand-writing the same sixty lines
// — open the screen, raw mode, mouse, dispatcher, decoder goroutine,
// select loop, deferred restore — and each copy had its own subtly
// different set of bugs. The parts that were merely tedious (setup) and
// the parts that were genuinely hard (signals, suspend, resize, dying
// with the terminal intact) are the same parts, so they move together.
//
// The loop is deliberately not extensible by adding select cases: an app
// cannot hand the framework another channel to wait on, because a
// dynamic select needs reflection. It does not need to. Everything
// asynchronous — timers, signals, watchers, network handlers — reaches
// the UI through the Dispatcher, which is the confinement rule anyway
// (see dispatch.go). Every hook here runs on the UI goroutine, where
// touching properties is legal.
//
// Typical shape:
//
//	var app *gooey.App
//	ctx := &markup.Context{Values: map[string]any{
//	    "Quit": gooey.Command(func() { app.Quit() }),
//	}}
//	app = gooey.NewApp(markup.Page(os.DirFS("."), "page.gooey", ctx))
//	if err := app.Run(context.Background()); err != nil {
//	    gooey.Exit(err)
