// Seeding a new element.
//
// A palette that adds <VStack> to a canvas has to decide what the new one
// looks like, and until this file existed the answer was three tables in
// the EDITOR, none of them per element:
//
//   - a per-Kind literal guess, which is where "x" came from as the value
//     of every required string attribute;
//   - a per-GoType placeholder switch, which had no arm for image.Image,
//     so <Image> could not be added at all;
//   - a per-ChildMode child, which hardcoded Header="tab" because it was
//     written for <Tabs> — so <MenuBar>'s <Menu>, which wants Title, would
//     not load either.
//
// Measured on the palette of 28: two elements that did not load, four
// that measured 0x0 — invisible on the canvas and, because hitTest never
// returns a zero-size component, unselectable in order to be fixed.
//
// The answer is per element and it is markup, because the answer has to
// cover more than attributes: an empty <VStack> measures nothing whatever
// its attributes say. See ElementDef.Seed for the contract.
//
// What markup CANNOT carry is a live handle. A bind-only attribute
// (<Checkbox Checked>, <Gauge Value>) takes {{.Path}} and nothing else,
// and ten of the fourteen required attributes in the vocabulary are that
// shape — so a seed names the binding and the inserter registers the
// value. Seeded does both halves, and it is the only place that knows the
// naming convention, so an editor and this package's own tests cannot
// disagree about it.

// PlaceholderFor returns a zero-ish source property for a declared
// GoType, for seeding a binding nobody has wired yet.
//
// The switch IS the type check — the same mechanism Bound uses, and the
// reason none of this needs reflection. It lives here rather than in a
// palette because AttrSpec.GoType is declared here: a type this cannot
// answer for is a gap in the vocabulary, and
// TestEverySeededElementLoadsAndOccupiesSpace fails on it. In the editor
// that same gap was a status line reading "no placeholder for
// image.Image" beside an add that silently did nothing.
//
// The values are not all zero. A Sparkline bound to an empty slice and a
// Segmented bound to no options are both technically seeded and both
// render as nothing, which is the failure this exists to prevent — so
// collection types get a couple of entries and Color gets a visible one.
// Nil for a type with no placeholder, which callers must treat as an
// error rather than as an empty binding.

// from sharing state: without it a second <Checkbox> would tick the first
// one, which is not a subtle bug but is a silent one, because both
// documents load.
//
// Returning the values rather than mutating a Context is deliberate. The
