// block for a human to read and run, which is the deck's guest list kept
// somewhere other than the deck.
//
// It rotted the way those do, and not subtly: on the machine where this
// test was written, ALL FOUR guests were missing, so beats 1.5, 1.6 and
// 1.7 would each have opened showing a red island instead of the app the
// beat exists to show. The list was also wrong in the other direction —
// it built `intro`, which beat 3.2's watchgo.sh compiles itself.
//
// guests.sh derives the set from the deck's own `Cmd=` attributes. This
// test derives it AGAIN, independently, in Go, and requires the two to
// agree — the same two-mechanism check ci.yml's discovery gets.
