// wysiwyg: a terminal UI builder that edits gooey markup, driven
// entirely by the component catalog.
//
// This is the catalog's first real consumer, and it exists to test the
// SHAPE rather than to be a finished editor. Three claims from
// docs/specs/2026-08-11-component-catalog-and-wysiwyg-builder.md are
// exercised here against running code:
//
//  1. The palette comes from (*markup.Context).Catalog(), and an element
//     whose attributes are not knowable renders DIFFERENTLY from one
//     that takes no attributes. A registered component is deliberately
//     present so that case is visible rather than theoretical.
//
//  2. The inspector comes from markup.AttrsFor(spec, parent) — never
//     from spec.Attrs directly, which is a true statement about the
//     element and a misleading answer to "what can I set here".
//
//  3. Attached properties are scoped to the PARENT. Press `c` and `v` to
//     retype the container between <Canvas> and <VStack> and watch
//     Canvas.Left enter and leave the selected child's attribute list.
//     That is the rule a flat per-element list cannot express, and the
//     one whose absence would have the editor offering positioning that
//     applyLayout silently discards.
//
// # The page is empty, and that is the current state of the work
//
// The four-pane shell this file used to arrange is gone:
//
//	┌────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
//	│ Preview   (REBUILT)        │ Palette          │
//	├────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
//	│ Markup output              │ Inspector INPUTS │
//	└────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘
//
// It worked, and it was the wrong shape: it made you operate a markup
// TREE and showed you a canvas as a side effect, when the canvas is what
// you want to touch. Rearranging four boxes would not have fixed that, so
// the layout is being built again rather than edited — canvas first.
//
// What survives, and where:
//
//   - the four panes, as controls in components/<pane>/, each declaring
//     its own surface with <x:Property> and owning its own chrome. They
//     are unmounted, not deleted: wysiwyg.gooey no longer instantiates
//     them. panes_test.go is what still holds them to their contracts.
//   - everything below the panes — the document model, the catalog-driven
//     palette and inspector, the per-Kind editors, remote mode — is
//     untouched. It is the part that was never the problem.
//
// The one structural rule the old layout existed to enforce is now
// enforced by construction: the preview subtree is thrown away and rebuilt
// on every edit, and replacing a subtree resets component-local state — a
// caret most visibly. <Preview> is a control whose markup is a fixed
// Border around its host, with no slot for children, so an input inside
// the rebuilt island is no longer an arrangement a page can express.
//
// # Building the next one
//
// The editor serves its own control plane (-serve, -mcp) as well as
// attaching to another app's (-attach). That is not symmetry for its own
// sake: with no UI left, patching the running editor through its own
// control plane is how the next UI arrives, and serve_test.go is the
// evidence that the empty page can actually receive one.
//

//	esc              select the PARENT of the selection
//
// # Selecting
//
// SHALLOW-FIRST, THE BLEND MODEL, and it is worth being precise about
// which parts of it were verified rather than remembered:
//
//   - a single click selects the OUTERMOST element under the pointer that
//     is a child of the current drill scope — not of the document root.
//     The scope moves as you drill, which is what makes repeated drilling
//     work at all;
//   - a double-click drills EXACTLY ONE LEVEL, not to the deepest hit.
//     Going straight to the bottom would put the intermediate containers
//     back out of reach, which is the defect this model exists to remove;
//   - esc selects the PARENT. That spelling is Microsoft's — "To select
//     the parent of a current selection in the designer, press the ESC
//     key" — and not Figma's, where esc deselects entirely. It walks the
//     scope up with it, so the next click at the same cell re-selects
//     what esc landed on instead of drilling straight back in.
//
// This INVERTED the deepest-first policy that came before it, and the
// reason was a real defect rather than a preference: a <Border> is
// covered entirely by its own child, so every press inside one selected
// the child and the container was reachable only through its one-cell
// chrome — effectively unselectable, and after the drag work effectively
// unmovable.
//
// THE DRILL SCOPE IS DERIVED, not stored: it is parentOf(selection),
// clamped to the user's root. A stored scope would need resetting by hand
// from four places (a click outside it, a delete, a retype, a rebuild)
// and each one it was forgotten in is a designer that selects something
// with no visible reason. See select.go.
//
// A press that lands on no element selects NOTHING, and the properties
// grid goes empty. That is deliberate rather than a gap: the design
// surface is the editor's workspace and is never written to the saved
// document, so selecting it would point the grid at something the user
// cannot save and offer attributes that never reach their file. ctrl+n
// and ctrl+p are the way back out of the empty state — with nothing
// selected they start from whichever end the direction implies, so a
// stray click on the background cannot strand you.
//
// The selection is a NODE, not an index. That is what lets it hold
// "nothing" without a sentinel and name a node at any depth.
//
// # The surface, and what a save writes
//
// The designer draws the document on a <Canvas> that is the editor's
// WORKSPACE — it exists so everything on it has free geometry to be moved
// in, and it is not part of what the user is building. The user's own
// root lives inside it:
//
//	<Canvas Name="Surface">      the workspace, never saved
//	  <Canvas Name="Root">       the USER'S root — this is the document
//	    <Text/> <Button/>        what they placed
//
// A save writes from the user's root down. So does the CODE tab, the
// OUTPUT tab and pushRemote — one artifact seen three ways. Only the
// preview builds the wrapper, because only the preview needs the
// geometry.
//
// Two consequences worth knowing before they surprise you. Pressing what
// looks like empty background usually selects the user's ROOT, because a
// <Canvas> root fills the surface — there is bare surface to click only
// when the root does not cover it. And `c`/`v` retype the USER'S root,
// never the surface; both are Canvases by default, so retyping the wrong
// one would change how the workspace lays out and leave the saved
// document untouched.
//
// # Moving
//
// Drag an element on the surface and it moves. WHAT THAT MEANS IS DECIDED
// BY THE PARENT, because free geometry belongs to the parent and not to
// the element:
//
//   - a child of a <Canvas> has Canvas.Left/Canvas.Top and goes wherever
//     the pointer goes;
//   - a child of a <Grid> has Grid.Row/Grid.Col and SNAPS to whichever
//     cell the pointer is in;
//   - a child of a <VStack> has no geometry at all — its position is its
//     index — so a drag there means reorder, which is not implemented.
//
// The snap happens DURING the drag, cell to cell, not on release. An
// element that floated under the pointer and jumped into a cell when the
// button came up would be a preview that lies about what the release is
// going to do, which is what people report as a bug.
//
// TWO ELEMENTS MAY LAND IN THE SAME CELL. Grid renders that as an overlap
// and reports nothing, and it is accepted rather than solved: bumping the
// second element would move something the user did not drag, and refusing
// the drop would fail the gesture for a reason the pointer gives no cue
// about. The overlap is at least visible on screen.
//
// A REFUSED DRAG SAYS SO. A press on a child of a stack selects it and
// then writes a sentence into the status bar naming the element and the
// container that decided it — because a gesture that silently does
// nothing is what a broken editor looks like too, and there was no
// diagnostic anywhere to tell them apart.
//
// The gesture is two-speed, and the split is the whole design: each
// motion writes the attached properties on the LIVE COMPONENT's
// gooey.Layout (Left/Top, or Row/Col) and asks for a frame, and only the
// release writes markup and rebuilds. Writing markup per motion would
// re-mount the entire designer subtree per pointer report and would look
// identical on screen — which is why drag_test.go pins per-motion and
// on-release damage as a COMPARISON rather than as constants. Measured on
// a two-element document: 6 per motion, 12 on release, 7 when the motion
// drags across another element.
//
// THE POSITIONS HAVE NOWHERE TO LIVE, and that is stated rather than
// solved. Things are positioned on a surface that is never saved, so the
// in-flight offset exists only in memory (dragState) until a release
// records it as Canvas.Left/Top on the element itself. Nothing here
// invents a home for design-time state — no attribute, no comment, no
// property element.
//
// The pointer is a second way in, never the only one. ctrl+n and ctrl+p
// remain the whole gesture from the keyboard, which is not politeness:
// mouse reports cannot be injected through a recording pty at all, so a
// designer that could only be driven by pointer could never be captured.
// See select.go for how the press finds its node, and why the framework
// needed no new seam for it.
//
// # DESIGN and LIVE
//
// The designer pane is a gooey.Frozen host, which is what a design surface
// is FOR: in DESIGN mode (the default) the document lays out and paints
// exactly as it will, and nothing in it is tabbable, clickable, hoverable
// or running — you cannot accidentally operate the thing you are drawing,
// and a <Companion> dropped on the canvas does not spawn its process.
// Press d and the same tree gets its behaviour back so you can try it.
//
// Nothing is re-mounted for that. `design` is one source property; the
// pane's Frozen() reads it, the Composer observes the read, and the frame
// the keystroke schedules re-derives the focus order, the scoped bindings,
// the mnemonics, the hover watchers and the Startable set before anything
// paints. This editor is that mechanism's first consumer, and the mechanism
// stayed a documented constraint until there was one.
//
// The bindings live on the page ROOT. A KeyBinding only fires while the
// focused chain passes through its host, and an empty page has no focus
// stop — on an inner element it would never fire and the app could not be
// quit.
//
// Everything must stay keyboard-operable: mouse events cannot be
// exercised under a recording pty, so a demo that needed one could never
// be captured.
