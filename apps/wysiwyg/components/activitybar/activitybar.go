// Package activitybar is the VS Code activity rail: a narrow vertical
// strip of icons down the left edge, with the active one marked.
//
// It is the first piece of chrome in this editor drawn in PIXELS rather
// than cells, and it is a deliberate choice of where to spend them. A
// terminal draws text well and shapes badly; an icon is a shape.
//
// # The icons are real assets, rasterized at the size they are drawn
//
// They are VS Code's own Codicons — the SVGs in icons/ next to this file,
// fetched from microsoft/vscode-codicons. A codicon is a 16x16 monochrome
// document declaring fill="currentColor", so it has to be rasterized at
// the size it will be drawn and tinted before it is rasterized rather than
// after. Both live in svg.IconSet now, along with the cache that keeps
// either off the paint path; this package supplies the three things that
// are actually its own — Dir, iconPx, and the two state colours.
//
// Attribution: Codicons are copyright Microsoft Corporation, licensed
// CC-BY-4.0. See icons/LICENSE.
//
// # What pixels cost, stated once
//
// A sixel band is invisible to every screen-level check this repo has.
// screen_text reads the CELL plane, so it reports blanks where the rail
// is; agg records the cell plane, so a demo capture shows nothing there
// either. The rail is therefore verified by a human looking at a terminal
// and by unit tests over the image it generates — which is why RailImage
// is a plain function returning an image.Image.
//
// Where the terminal has no pixel protocol the framework's halfblock
// fallback draws the same image into the cell plane at half vertical
// resolution. The rail degrades; it does not disappear.

//
// ONE Image, not one per icon. A sixel band writes pixels into the cell
// grid and damages the cells it covers as a unit, so four stacked bands
// are four damage rects that can tear against each other when only the
// selection moved. One band repaints once.
//
// Src is a COMPUTED image — a picture derived from the selection, which
// redraws when the selection changes because a computed that reads a
// property subscribes to it. No invalidate call, no clock.
// Def is Builder plus the declaration, for hosts that register through
// Context.Elements. It is what makes the rail DESCRIBABLE rather than
// merely nameable, and the bug it fixes was reported from the running
// editor: clicking ActivityBar in the toolbox emitted
//
//	<ActivityBar Name="ActivityBar1"/>
//
// which fails to load with "needs Sel=". The palette seeds an inserted
// element's required attributes from AttrSpec.Required + GoType, and a
// Builder registration has no Attrs to read — so it offered an element
// it could not produce valid markup for. Declaring Sel closes that: the
// palette now seeds a bound int handle and the insert loads.
//
// Registering through Elements also turns on the attribute check, so
// <ActivityBar Sell="{{.X}}"> becomes a load error with a near-miss
// suggestion instead of an attribute nothing reads. Builder is kept for
// hosts that predate the seam and for the tests that use it directly.
