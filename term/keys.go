// recoverable reports whether a tty read error is one the decoder should
// retry rather than treat as the end of terminal input.
//
// The distinction is the whole point: this loop used to return on ANY
// error, and because nothing closes the events channel and nothing
// watched the decoder, a single transient read error left the app
// running, painting, and permanently deaf — no log, no exit, no
// tripwire. DecoderLeaked guards the opposite failure (a decoder that
// OUTLIVES teardown); this is the one where it dies too early.
//
// EINTR is a signal arriving mid-read — SIGWINCH on every window resize,
// among others — and is not a terminal condition. ErrDeadlineExceeded is
// a deadline set by something else on this fd (Detect uses one) expiring
// under the decoder; also not a terminal condition.
//
// EAGAIN is deliberately NOT here. On a pollable fd the runtime retries
// it internally so it never surfaces; if it does surface, the fd has left
// the netpoller (see Screen.control on why that must never happen) and
// retrying would spin at 100% CPU forever. Reporting it and stopping is
// worse for that one case and far better for every other: a loud failure
// beats a silent one, which is the lesson this whole function encodes.

// DecodeEvents reads the tty and sends decoded events — keys and, if

// It runs in its own goroutine; the decoding itself lives in the input
// package (pure, testable), so this function is only I/O and the
// escape-timeout policy.
//
// This is the primitive. Prefer Screen.Events, which starts it and hands
// the Screen ownership of the goroutine, because ownership is what lets
// Restore prove it died — and a terminal handed to a child process while
// one of our readers is still on it is the bug this whole lifecycle
// exists to prevent. A decoder started here by hand is nobody's, and
// teardown will not wait for it.
